Description:When I started this project, my inspiration was that they made people from different cultures meet and learn languages ​​along with it. While creating the project, I made use of flask, python, sql, html and css. The homepage welcomes us at first with (homepage.html) and extends from layout.html' like all the pages.There is a text explaining the purpose of the page and what it does, and a button that simultaneously performs both the registration and login functions. The button directs us to this double-tasking page(register.html) and if we entered the information for the first time, it saves us to the database, but not before. If we have registered, it finds us from the database and logs in, thus avoiding any dilemmas or problems. At the same time, if we leave any blank input or an empty option, it redirects to the registration page.Then, if it is our first login, we are directed to the search page, and on this page (personalSearch.html), we display our own information and display a button to search.When we press the button, if there is no match, a failure page (notFound.html) greets us and states in its description that the user information is saved in the database, it can be matched at any time, to come and check it once in a while.If a match is found, a success page (showMatch.html) welcomes us and includes a table with the information of the person we matched next to an entertaining gif.If logged in to check after registration (personalSearch.html) it skips the page on failure (notFound.html) but if there is a match (matchFound.html) it redirects to page
