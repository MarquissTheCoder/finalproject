## Description

CS50 Student Exchange is a web application designed to bring together individuals from different cultures, facilitating language learning and cultural exchange. This project was created using a combination of technologies, including Flask, Python, SQL, HTML, and CSS.

### Features

- **Homepage:** The homepage (homepage.html) greets users and serves as the starting point for the application. It shares the project's purpose and functionality. Users can also find a button that serves both registration and login functions.

- **Registration:** Clicking the registration/login button redirects users to the registration page (register.html). Here, users can input their information, which is saved to the database upon registration. The system ensures that no blank input or empty options are accepted, promoting data integrity.

- **Login:** Registered users can log in, and the system retrieves their information from the database, providing a seamless experience.

- **Search:** Upon successful login, users are directed to the search page (personalSearch.html). Here, users can view their own information and initiate a search. If there's no match, a failure page (notFound.html) informs the user that their information is saved in the database and can be matched in the future. If a match is found, a success page (showMatch.html) displays the matched user's information alongside an entertaining GIF.

### Usage

- **Registration and Login:** To begin, visit the homepage and click the registration/login button. Fill in the required information for registration or log in if you're already registered.

- **Searching:** After successful login, access your personal search page. You can initiate a search and receive instant results. If no match is found, the system will let you know that your information is stored for future matching.
